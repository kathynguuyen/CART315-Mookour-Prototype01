# Mookour - Prototype 01


# Design hypothesis

For my first prototype, I just wanted to start with the basics that we learned in class first. Therefore, I used the different 3D shapes to make a small parkour. I explored using the third person controller in order to make the player play as a cow. I wanted to try a different perspective rather than the first person perspective one. I also added some materials. 


# List of questions for playtesters
 
1. Does the third person perspective feel weird?
2. Should the camera be further from the cow or closer? 
3. Is the first parkour too hard to accomplish?
