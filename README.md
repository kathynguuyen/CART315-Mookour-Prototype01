# Mookour - Iteration Prototype

# Design hypothesis

I wanted to explore more how to make parkour fair but also challenging. I also wanted to keep my theme of a cow doing parkour. In this prototype, I fixed the main bugs that were encountered by all my playtesters. I also started to work on the second level of the parkour. However, for this prototype I want to make the environment more fit for the cow so maybe a farm environment. For the final, I was thinking of making a main menu and refine the whole game.

# Fixes and added things

- Changed the camera
- Put different platforms (not the angled ramp anymore)
- Added background music

# Questions

1. Is the camera position better?
2. Does the soundtrack fit the game or should it be more upbeat?
3. Should the environment of the parkour be in a city or a farm? 
4. Is the first parkour level became too easy or it's at a decent difficulty?

# Reflection and Feedback

For my final game, I wanted to find the perfect balance in order to make the game challenging as well as not impossible. In this case, I tried to increase the difficulty increase bit by bit. From the feedback, I wanted to make the environment more aesthetically pleasing so I made it into a city. I still have a problem with a collider where my cow would get stuck into the platform. 

Improvements to make for final game 

- Environment
- Small camera ajustment
- Better parkour levels



# Mookour - Prototype 01


# Design hypothesis

For my first prototype, I just wanted to start with the basics that we learned in class first. Therefore, I used the different 3D shapes to make a small parkour. I explored using the third person controller in order to make the player play as a cow. I wanted to try a different perspective rather than the first person perspective one. I also added some materials. 


# List of questions for playtesters
 
1. Does the third person perspective feel weird?
2. Should the camera be further from the cow or closer? 
3. Is the first parkour too hard to accomplish?


# Reflections

I realized that the parkour is a little bit too hard because of how I put the platforms. I think I will be a flatter platform and bigger platforms for the cow to jump on. I should also put the camera a bit further from the cow in order for the player to maneuver it better and play better.
